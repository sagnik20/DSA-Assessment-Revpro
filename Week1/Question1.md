# Array Operations: 
## Difference between X and Y

You have an array of N elements.
Find and print the difference between the Xth and Yth largest elements of the given array. 

**Function Description**

In the provided code snippet, implement the provided difference(...) method using arrays, number of elements, and number of players passed as parameters. You can write your code in the space below the phrase “WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE”.

There will be multiple test cases running so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided. The base Output variable result is set to a default value of -404 which can be modified.
Additionally, you can add or remove these output variables. 

**Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer N, the size of the array.
The next line contains N space-separated integers i.e. array elements. 
The next line contains two space-separated integers X and Y. 

**Sample Input**
```
3
3 1 2
1 3
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= N <= 1000 
1 <= X <= Y <= N 
1 <= A[i] <= 1000
```

**Output Format** 

Print the required integer in a single line. 

**Sample Output**

```
2
```

**Explanation**

The 1st greatest element in the array is 3 and the 3rd greatest element in the array is 1. 
Hence, their difference is 3 - 1 = 2.
